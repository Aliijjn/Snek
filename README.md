This is my version of Snake, which I made using C and the library Windows.h.
The entire game is only made with the barebones graphics of Windows.h, all textures consist of hardcoded rectangles :P
Theres a slight bug with the textures of the snake not always working at the edges of the map, but everything else works perfectly fine!

Use this project for whatever you like :)
